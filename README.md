# It's My Fault - A Game Jam Project
"It's My Fault" is a game project specially made for BJIT presents BUET CSE Fest 2023 Game Jam. It is a short game where "You are your enemy". You have a laser emitter that produces lethal laser beam. You need to escape the rooms without damaging less and getting sliced by your own laser.
